# Data Storage {-}

Data Storage is a term made up of three components. In this section we will walk you through determining the amount of storage, where to store your active research data, and finally, storing your data for the long term, generally known as data preservation. Backing up your data, while also a storage issue, is handled separately. 

Data storage is important but becomes urgent when you don't have enough space to store all your data files. This is especially true if you are part way through a research project and are unable to save and/or capture data because you have run out of data storage space. If you are uncertain how to estimate the amount of storage you require, people in Research Computing and Advanced Research Computing are available to help you quickly and easily determine this.

## General Rules {-}

1. Know what the subject of your data is as this will determine where you can store it and whether or not additional security measures are recommended or required
2. Determine approximations for how much data your project will generate
3. Outline whether your collaborators (if any) are from within UBC or outside of UBC
4. 

* Determine what level of security your files and data require. Working with human data *may* require different storage than data that is not of human origin or relating to human participants or subjects.
* Allocate storage for original (raw) data, cleaned or organized data, processed and analyzed data, documentation that informs users about your data, draft papers, charts, visualizations, photos, ans supplementary items that go within your papers. You will likely also need some, generally small, amount of space for the admimistrative documents of your project such as grant applications and the like.
* Allocate sufficient storage in different locations for back-ups.
* Arrange for sufficient or additional storage well before it is actually required. Sometimes you have instant access to needed additional storage, and in other cases, it takes time to gain access.
* Decide who needs access to which files. Principal Investigators (PIs) and lab managers often have access to all the files at all times while students beginning work in the lab may only have access to the files into which they are entering data. Graduate students and post docs may have access to more files. Record who has access to which files. Record all the locations (specific drive, or other exact location) and who has access to which locations.
* Apply standardized file names to all your files (see Chapter 2) and directory structures (see Chapter 3) to all storage locations

Depending on what types of information the file contains, how exactly these guidelines are implemented will differ slightly.

## Quick Reference {-}

| Type | Stoage Location |
| --- | --- |
| Data about non-humans | **Teams** Good for collaborating on documents.<br />**OneDrive** Cloud Storage good for many kinds of data and file formats |
| Non-sensitive Human data| **Teams** Good for collaborating on documents.<br />**OneDrive** Cloud Storage good for many kinds of data and file formats |
| Big Data |  **UBC Administered** Sockeye or Chinook.<br />**Contact** Consult an ARC consultant about your requirements. www.arc.ubc.ca <br /> **Compute Canada** Consult an ARC consultant about your requirements. www.arc.ubc.ca

### Storage locations NOT recommended by UBC {-}

* **Drop Box** Cloud storage servers are located in the US and do not provide meet the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) requirements for UBC researchers.
*  **Google Drive** Cloud storage servers are located in the US and do not provide meet the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) requirements for UBC researchers.


    
**How *many* copies of files and the locations of these copies matters.**


A **best practice** for files is to have <br/> 
    ***3*** copies in<br>
    ***2*** formats (i.e. laptop harddrive and removeable harddrive)<br>
    ***1*** stored off-site


## File Naming Conventions {-}

Utilize a standardized file naming convention as outlined in the File Naming section.


## Roles and Responsibilities {-}


You may have multiple projects occuring within your lab concurrently and it's worth noting that these different projects may have different storage requirements. Additionally, file naming conventions will become specifically more important so files for separate projects do not become mixed.



## Questions {-}

1. Where will active project storage occur? (laptop, lab computer, OneDrive, Teams etc)
2. Where will active projects be backed up to? How often will back-ups be run?
3. At project completion, how long will the following be kept (UBC minimum requirements, other...)
    a. Data
    b. Code
    c. Manuscripts and posters
4. At project completion, where will files be stored?
5. At time of publication / presentation, where will files be shared? (Dataverse, OSF, OneDrive etc.)
6. Will the lab use Dataverse for data deposit?
    a. What will the structure of Dataverse look like?
7. Will you use disk level encryption? If so, whe, and what service?
8. Will you use file level encryption? If so, when, and what service?
