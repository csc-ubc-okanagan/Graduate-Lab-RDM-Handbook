# Roles & Responsibilities {-}

A lab manual is a way to communicate the protocols, practices, and procedures (among other things) of a research lab or group, with the goal of avoiding confusion and misunderstandings.  When creating a lab or team manual, defining roles and responsibilities, and ensuring that everybody is very clear about their role in managing a project’s data, is of primary importance.

The roles and responsibilities of your research will come into play in all other modules in this guide, and while we all want things to go perfectly, life happens and things can slip off track.  If things do start to become disorganized, this shouldn’t be a source of shame or embarrassment, and you can use this guide as a reference to help get things back in order.  

## General Rules {-}

While not technically "rules", below are some suggestions and things to consider when developing your lab manual.

* **Designating Roles**: If you have research or lab manager in your group, designating responsibilities can largely fall to this person.  However, if your group does not have this as a formal role, it is important that the team discusses and designates roles and responsibilities amongst themselves, and that everybody has a clear idea of what others are doing, and what is expected of them. These roles should be documented somewhere. See the chapter on documentation.
* **Access Permissions**: It’s very possible that everybody within a research group won’t need access to all the group’s data.  It’s also possible that due to data sensitivities and restrictions, there will be team members who explicitly should not have access to some data.  In addition to designating who will provision access permissions, it’s also important to clearly outline and manage each team member’s data access.  This should be incorporated in both the onboarding and offboarding of team members.
* **Onboarding**: When a person first joins a research group, things can be overwhelming and not all information will be retained.  While it’s important to ensure there is a person or person who is responsible for onboarding, and that roles and responsibilities are explained to new members, it is equally important for there to be a documentation for reference (and that the documentation be updated as necessary).
* **Updating**: Just as much as it’s valuable to develop naming conventions, folder hierarchies, versioning practices, and documentation, it’s equally (and potentially more) important to ensure that the documentation of any new additions or practices be updated.  Determining who will update the documentation will be specific to every team, and again, ensuring that expectations are clearly communicated is key. 
*  **Setting a Schedule**: Whether it’s daily, weekly, bi-weekly, etc., having regularly scheduled tasks that can apply to specific group members or to everybody, will help keep things consistent and updated.  This can apply to things like backups and reviewing any documentation that may need to be updated due to changes or additions. 
*  **Regular Check-ins**: Everybody is busy, but it’s useful to have regular check-ins to make sure everything is staying on track, and to address any issues or questions people may have.
