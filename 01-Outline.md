# Outline {-}

4 potential bigger buckets

* Naming and organization
* Data Storage
* Roles and Responibilities
* The Wrap Up

Research Data Management (RDM) at its core is about being organized, which means being intentional and coordinated - when working with others - about where we put things, how we name things, how we describe things, and - with everything likely stored on a computer - how we do this all in a way that is both human and machine accessible. The spin off of this is reasearch that is transparent, reproducible, and, if desired, shareable.

It can seem like a lot. But working with a couple of principles and with a little planning, it's not hard to tackle.

### Roles & Responsibilities {-}

It's important to know - when working in a team - who is resonsible for what. This chapter walks you through some of the questions a research team should be asking themselves at the outset about who will be doing what and when. These are then addressed in more detail in each subsequent section.

### Offboarding {-}

Tightly wed to roles and responsibilities, when someone leaves a research project, things need to be passed along and access to components of a research project need to be updated. This chapter covers considerations and approaches to handling offboarding.

### File Naming {-}

There are few things more frustrating then when preparing for a submission and opening a folder to find somethign like the following list of files...

```
Anlaysis to be reviewed.docx
Analysis to be reviewed MVD.docx
Analysis to be reviewed final.docx
Analysis to be reviewed FINAL.docx
Analysis FINAL.docx
Analysis FINAL - Updated.docx
Analysis - Last update - FINAL.docx
```

This chapter covers common conventions to avoid this headache - allowing you to look at a file and determine it's author, it's place in the chain of edits, and if needed, to use code to extract files of a specific designation from across and within complex nested folder structures.

### Directory Structures {-}

When projects get complex, file naming alone is not sufficient. When we're working across multiple projects, having fundamentally different organizational structures can be frustrating. This chapter covers common convetions in setting up directory structures that help streamline how new projects are started, who has access to what kind of content, and with the use of a template sets a common structure across projects.

### Permissions & Ownership {-}

Not everyone needs access - nor shoudl everyone require access - to everything related to a research project. Data in particular may be sensitive. This chapter covers approaches to establishing ownership over files and directories and setting permissions - the abaility to access or edit - on these for different partners in the research project.

### File Formats {-}

One person works in `.csv` another in `.xls` another in `.xlsx` and yet another in `.ods`. This limits portability of the information, risks introducing file errors as they are passed between computing environments, and causes headaches when you're not working in your preferred format in your preferred application. This chapter covers approaches to standardizing file formats used across a research project.

### Documentation {-}

How roles are assigned for a specific project, what naming conventions and directory structures should be used, how specific aspects of a research project should be undertaken should all be articulated. This serves as a reminder, it keeps people accountable, and it simplifies onboarding new research partners to an existing project. This chapter covers conventions for migrating tacit knowledge to documentation throughout a research project to ensure the project is comprehensible.

### Version Control {-}

Sometimes we need to track changes in certain documents over time. Version control let's us know what the currrent working copy is and how a file has changed over time. Version control can be handled by software, but also through naming conventions. This chapter covers common approaches to tackling version control with naming conventions.

### Data Storage  {-}

Research data often has restrictions or obligations for where it's stored and how long it's stored for. Research data is also incredibly value, so we'd be loath to keep only one copy of it. This chapter covers outlining storage solutions from the outset that address potential restrictions and obligations. It also covers approaches to keeping multiple copies of research data to protect against accidental loss.
