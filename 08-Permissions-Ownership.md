title: "08 Permissions & Ownership"
---

Managing access and permissions at the project, directory, and file level is not an easy task. However, not everyone involved in a given project needs or should have access to every aspect of that project.

When preparing for a research project, and mapping out the directory structure and storage locations that will be used, we should think about the following roles and which should have access to what parts of a project:

* Primary investigator
* Lead researcher
* Lab manager
* Research collaborators
* Graduate assistants
* Undergraduate assistants
* Funders
* Editors and Reviewers
* The public

Depending, some of these actors may not be relevant, and some may need further breakdown when thinking about roles in the research project and access and permission needs.

Most systems allow three levels of access:

* Administrator or owner
* Read and write
* Read only

It's worth considering two other potential levels of access:

* Knowing something exists
* No knowledge

Generally, **administrators** have full control over what ever they preside on, wheterh this be at the project, directory, or file level. At the project level, they can generally invite and remove collaborators and make public or delete files. **Read and write** will allow a user or person to open (read) and edit (write) existing files. Depending on the system, read and write may allow users to delete or make public files and directories. It may also allow them to create new files. Generally read and write does not allow invitation or deletion of collaborators. However, it's always wise to ask these questions of whatever storage solution you're using to house your research. **Read only** generally only allows for the opening of a file, without the ability to edit, delete, or invite additional collaborators.

Even when someone is unable to read the contents of a file, we may wish to make them aware of its existence. Publishing, or making publicily available, a copy of your directory structure, is one way of doing this - one may be able to see the names of individual files and perhaps a `readme` file that describes the contents of the file, but does not actually reveal these contents. This may be useful in a data sharing scenario, where you may be willing or in a position to share your data upon request; a request can only come if someone knows there is something there to request.

When all data and metadata are stored on private media or are unpublished, non-collaborators will have zero knowledge of any of your research data or other files.

When prepaing for a project, access permissions for directories should be articulated based on collaborator roles. If needed, and if using a system that supports file level permissions, these too should be considered and articulated. A registry should then be maintained, listing all collaborators, their roles, and what they have access to. When leaving a project, collaborators should have their permissions and access updated.
